A little tool to extract youtube urls from a text stream. I'm sure there's a perl/bash one-liner for that but I'm too dumb for perl and C is my scripting language.

Usage: just feed it a text stream via stdin.
Example: curl https://8ch.net/cyber/res/32671.html | ./xyt | sort | uniq
Building: run build.sh (requires just clang, but I'm sure GCC works too)

You can then pump the output into youtube-dl, etc.
